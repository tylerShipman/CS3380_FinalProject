**Description:**
The purpose for this application is to keep track of team names and the players who are on the team. The application allows users to input information from basketball into two categories: Players and Schedule. The application also allows the users to view other inputs from other users. This creates an efficient database application.  

**Database Schema:**
The web interface is the central location to view different teams and players. From these options, the application shows specifics for each category. If you click on "Players" the application will allow you to view the player names, #'s, and postition. If "Team" is chosen, the application will allow you to view the different team names.

**Implementation of CRUD:**
