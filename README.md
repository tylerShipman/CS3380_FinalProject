Description:
The purpose for this application is a one stop shop for basketball statistics keeping. The application allows users to input statistics from basketball games into three categories: Players, Schedule, Stats. The application also allows the users to view other inputs from other users. This creates an efficient statistics keeping application.  

Database Schema:
The home page is the central location where you can branch off to look at either players, schedules, or stats. From those three options, the application shows specifics for each category. If you click on "Players" the application will take you to a page to view the player names, #'s, postition, and total stats. The "Schedule" option leads you to view either a list of upcoming games or select a specific game you want to view statistics for. If "Select a game" from the "Schedule" option is chosen, you will be taken to a players pane that shows the stats for that game. Lastly, if "Stats" is chosen, it shows different statistics per game.
